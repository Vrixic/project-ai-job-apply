# Native application preparation release composition — 2026-10-07

D3-017/D3-068 through D3-071/D3-079 now have a standalone default-off
[Terraform module](../../../../infrastructure/terraform/modules/native-application-preparation/README.md)
connecting the existing private activity, durable workflow, SQS starter, terminal handler and
scheduled reconciler. This is local source implementation, not environment integration or release.

The activity alone invokes the supplied original numeric launcher and uses distinct packet
encryption/HMAC keys. Durable orchestration invokes only the numeric activity and owns its
checkpoints. The starter consumes one request at a time with partial-batch failure reporting and
invokes retained numeric workflow versions. Separate recovery roles read original execution
metadata and settle through owning SQL; only the scheduled role may nudge the input queue.
Both recovery roles explicitly deny Lambda invocation. New intake requires runtime, launch and
recovery gates; recovery may remain enabled while the other gates are false. Existing immutable
versions and retained original resource ownership must survive until drain.

Four source/hash/version-bound artifacts produce five Lambda functions/roles. No database secret
reaches orchestration, and no runtime role gains S3, ECS or PassRole authority. Private Lambda
networking, pinned extension, existing encrypted queues and distinct packet keys are required.
The module references exact independently supplied bootstrap permissions ceilings. It creates
no bootstrap authority, queue, content process or network endpoint. The README lists the exact
remaining resource-policy, outbox, alarm, publisher, environment and original task prerequisites.

Validation: pinned Terraform 1.16.2 / AWS provider 6.58.0, backend disabled, mocked provider.
`terraform validate` and all seven `terraform test` scenarios pass. Tests cover absent/default-off
resources, numeric targets, strict terminal configuration, deny-invocation recovery, retained
versions, recovery without intake, rejected aliases/missing release, intake gating and enabled
flag composition. The first run caught an invalid 24-hour Lambda asynchronous window; corrected
to six hours while retaining EventBridge's independent 24-hour terminal retry. A mock rule ARN
fixture was also corrected. The final rerun passes after ordering IAM attachment and event
permissions before consumers/targets. Serverless infrastructure policy validation passes.
Ignored log: `.tmp/d3-native-application-preparation-terraform.log`.

No cloud calls, full workspace rerun, live runtime, effective IAM, migration, publication,
activation, frontend/client/ATS or accountable approval is claimed. No runtime TypeScript changed.
Bootstrap, publisher and platform/environment integration are the next connected implementation
steps. D1/D3 stay In progress; ADR-040 stays Proposed, Docker/WSL stay stopped and PC stays on.

## Guarded artifact family

`NativePreparation` is now a separate guarded publisher family matching this module's four
artifact names and `lambda/applications/native-preparation` source/hash key root. Dedicated
receipt/output roots and an exact sixteen-object inventory prevent accidental mixing with
Document, NativeResume or private-control receipts. Case variants select the same family.
Existing merge/source, audit, deterministic build, KMS/versioning and independent readback gates
are retained. No publisher Status/Publish/Verify cloud action was run.

The new family command compiles once, runs all four existing builders (including their actual
bundled refusal probes), then copies release companions into the family output. Individual
builder output paths remain available. PowerShell 5 and 7 publisher tests pass, including
mixed/incomplete/duplicated receipt refusals; scoped Biome checks pass. Actual packaging and
integrity validation pass at clean `e95e4ecacf027c83996fa89b6b95d0cea6a34527`. A second packaging
pass over the same compiled source produces sixteen identical files; this is not two clean
compilation runs or the publisher's complete pre-publication/audit sequence.

ZIP contents, source identity, bundle and ZIP hashes, byte lengths/base64 digests, checksum
companions and CycloneDX SBOM hashes/component counts pass independent local inspection.

Ignored logs and hash inventories are `.tmp/d3-native-preparation-{publisher-tests*,family-*}`.
No runtime TypeScript changed. Bootstrap ceilings, queue/network/key policies, outbox wiring,
alarms and development/staging composition remain the next connected source steps, followed by
managed acceptance. Existing dependency advisories remain open; no fresh audit or waiver is
claimed. All artifacts remain unpublished, Docker/WSL stopped, PC on.

## D1 — Useful web product and canonical job catalog

Authentication, canonical jobs, onboarding, search/saved jobs, moderation, entitlements and public-page source are implemented.
Final hosted/public acceptance, maintenance deployment and real-candidate/privacy/accessibility reviews remain.
[Implemented and remaining capabilities](phase-1-web-and-job-catalog.md).

## D3 — High-quality application preparation

Grounded preparation, packets/review, safe manual Apply, submission-safety controls and native runtime/test tooling are implemented.
The 2026-10-09 browser safety batch passes a simulated connected search-to-confirmed-history journey;
cover-letter opt-in/status/cancellation UI is locally tested behind a separate default-off flag.
Provider-neutral form plans reject conflicting claims/duplicate options and leave restricted answers and challenges to candidate action.
The owner-selected separate in-memory Auth0 PKCE path now supplies default-off native resume/cover-letter previews and approved PDF/DOCX downloads with local regression and synthetic Chromium evidence.
The owner-approved separate SPA registration is configured and its saved grant/origin settings are inspected; live sign-in/native acceptance remains unverified. Saved-answer selection and provider adapter/handoff source work remain.
Connected native/provider acceptance, ATS adapters/fixtures, all-copy expiry, rights/restore and accountable reviews remain.
The D3-012 engineering review packet now links current evidence; existing development dispositions remain unchanged.
[Implemented and remaining capabilities](phase-3-application-preparation.md).

## D0 — Product, data, and legal foundation

[Phase 0 tasks](phase-0-foundation.md).

## D2 — Extension and community loop

[Phase 2 tasks](phase-2-extension-and-community.md).

## D3.1 - Structured candidate profile

[Phase 3.1 tasks](phase-3-1-structured-profile.md).

## D4 — Workday and remote preparation

[Phase 4 tasks](phase-4-workday-and-remote.md).

## D5 — Personalized outreach and application notifications

[Phase 5 tasks](phase-5-outreach-and-notifications.md).

## D6 — Mobile and paid launch

[Phase 6 tasks](phase-6-mobile-and-paid.md).

## D7 — Quality optimization, expansion, and optional employer product

[Phase 7 tasks](phase-7-quality-and-expansion.md).

## Current operating state

Work resumed for D3 on 2026-10-09; D1/D3 are not complete. Independent D1 acceptance remains deferred.
Development SSO access is restored and current shutdown readback confirms dormant runtime capacity on 2026-10-09. Staging was verified off earlier that day, but its separate SSO session is now unavailable; fresh staging shutdown verification remains incomplete. No cloud runtime was started by these browser/form batches. Retained recovery/storage/security resources incur charges.
Docker/WSL shutdown is recorded in the linked evidence; the PC remains on.
[Current browser batch and shutdown evidence](evidence/d3-connected-candidate-journey-2026-10-09.md).

## Cross-delivery decisions and changes

Applications history belongs to D3, the generic inbox to D5, and structured Profile replacement to D3.1.
CI/CD work is deferred until production launch; independent launch security review remains required by ADR-015.
Real-candidate data and capability activation require their recorded authority; local tests do not establish production approval.

Historical work logs and decisions remain in Git history, phase documents, ADRs and linked evidence.

# API Gateway and BFF

The gateway is the authenticated entry point for web, mobile, extension, and admin clients. It enforces authorization, rate limits, API versioning, request validation, idempotency, and client-specific response composition.

## Planned subfolders

- `routes/` — Versioned public and internal endpoints.
- `bff/` — Web, mobile, extension, and admin response composition.
- `middleware/` — Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and tracing.
- `clients/` — Typed clients for domain services.
- `schemas/` — Runtime request/response validation.
- `tests/` — Contract, authorization, rate-limit, and integration tests.

The gateway must not perform long-running AI, ingestion, or browser work. It creates durable resources and returns their identifiers.

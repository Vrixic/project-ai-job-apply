# Durable Workflows

This directory contains Temporal workflow definitions for multi-step processes that must survive crashes, deploys, provider outages, and long user waits.

## Planned subfolders

- `applications/` — Prepare, inspect, review, approve, submit, and confirm.
- `job-ingestion/` — Normalize, deduplicate, verify, publish, and expire.
- `documents/` — Parse, tailor, validate, render, and verify.
- `notifications/` — Schedule, route, retry, and reconcile delivery.
- `integrations/` — OAuth sync, cursors, webhook reconciliation, and disconnect.
- `privacy/` — Export, revoke, delete, and subprocessor propagation.
- `billing/` — Webhook handling, reconciliation, and entitlement recovery.
- `tests/` — Replay, timeout, cancellation, compensation, and idempotency tests.

Workflow code orchestrates deterministic state transitions; external I/O belongs in retryable activities/workers.
